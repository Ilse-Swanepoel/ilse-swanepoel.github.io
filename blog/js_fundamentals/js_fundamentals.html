      <h3 class="question">HTML, CSS and JS</h3>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript all work together to make a functioning,
        beautiful and interactive webpage. HTML includes the structure and
        content. CSS includes the design and visual aspects of the webpage.
        JavaScript includes interactivity such as buttons and animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analogy time again. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are like a car. HTML is the
        structure, the chassis, of the car. CSS is the interior and exterior
        look, the design, of the car. JavaScript is what makes it GO. You push
        the accelerator and the car moves forwards, you turn the steering wheel,
        and the car turns.

      <h3 class="question">Functions and why they matter</h3>
      <p>
        A function is a very helpful tool. It allows us to <em>teach</em> the
        computer to do something, and then when we give the command at any
        point, it will do what we asked it to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if we wanted to teach a dog to do a trick, we wouldn't want
        the dog to do the trick all the time, only when you give the command. So
        you teach the dog what to do when you call the command, so that if they
        ever hear the command, the do what they have been taught. The same goes
        for the computer, once a function has been programmed, whenever you call
        that function, the computer will do the actions that were programmed.
