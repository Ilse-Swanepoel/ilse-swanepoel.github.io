      <p>
        In teaching, we often asked students questions about a text to see how
        much they understood from reading. The 2 main types were literal and
        inferential questions. Literal questions would be questions you can find
        in the text and inferential questions were a “read between the lines”
        type deal. Literal questions (IQ) could be answered by looking at the
        book. For example, what is Billy doing? “He is reading.” Inferential
        questions (EQ) were more complex and the children often referred to them
        as thinking questions. They had to look at different clues and figure
        out what was going. For example, how does Billy feel about reading? How
        do you know? “He hates it, look at his face. He looks grumpy and it says
        he sighed maybe he wants to go and do something else”.
