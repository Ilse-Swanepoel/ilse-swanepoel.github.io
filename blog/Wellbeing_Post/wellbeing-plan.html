        Through out bootcamp I have kept wellbeing at the forefront of my mind. I have kept up with physical excercise by joining most yoga sessions and going to the gym. I have worked hard to eat breakfast every morning and the supply on campus has definitely come in handy for days where I am running a little late. I have used my time on the bus to listen to music. I have spent my weekends doing bits and pieces to stay on top of my work load but also to see my friends either in person, or virtually. I have continued to eat dinner with my family and enjoy some board games every now and then. I have used my lunch breaks to take walks in the domain and get some fresh air and sunshine. I truely feel this has helped me stay optomistic during bootcamp and has contributed to feeling grounded and not feeling over-whelmed.

        Below is my wellbeing plan. It outlines how I will take care of my wellbeing in relation to the Hauora and the whare tapa wha model. All of these aspects are heavily intertwined, if one suffers, others will follow. For this reason it is essential to look after all aspects with balance.
