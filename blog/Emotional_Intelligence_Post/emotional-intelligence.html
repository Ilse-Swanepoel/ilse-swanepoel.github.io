  <h3 class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  
  <p>“Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively. This ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others.”1

<br>
Essentially, EQ is understanding your own thoughts and feelings, as well as those of others.
<br>    
<br>
People are extremely complex, with complex emotions and needs. So, as a way to break down a complex and abstract concept such as EQ, I will use an analogy (because I always find them helpful, maybe you will too). Think of the ocean, in whatever form you like. Maybe it’s grey and rough with lots of waves or maybe it's shimmering and calm in the sunlight, like a mirror.  That surface, is a person’s outward emotion, what we see. Maybe they are angry, maybe they are calm. Understanding what their emotion is, is only one part though. But what is causing this emotion? What is going on underneath those powerful waves, or that shimmering light?
<br>    
<br>
Knowing that what you see on the surface and what is going on underneath can be totally different and can be different from person to person is part of EQ.
