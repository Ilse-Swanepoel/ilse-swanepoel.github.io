      <h3 class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        That is a great question. I have switched careers/ jobs a few times in
        my life already. My aim now is to become a software developer and get a
        job to progress my skills further. Eventually, I want ot be able to use
        my skills to create software/programs/websites etc to be used my
        teachers within schools to better the engagement of students

      <h3 class="question">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I work hard and I can keep working on things that I find a challenge
        without giving up. But I can often get distracted by little things that
        aren't a priority. I can be quite self-critical and I lack self-disciple
        and organisation.

      <h3 class="question">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Self-Disciple in terms of staying on task and getting things done in a
        timely manner. Organisational and time management skills.

      <h3 class="question">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:

        <ol>
          <li>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
            <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </li>
        </ol>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have been using toggl and the time boxes to help with time management.
        I take regular breaks approxamitely every 2 hours. I make sure I have
        water on hand and I get excercise everyday,too. I plan out my week on
        the Monday morning to allocate time for everything and just to make sure
        other commits do not interfere with my studies.

      <h3 class="question">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am pretty good at asking for help when I need it. I usually try the
        problem myself, then google, then check the forums, then ask for help
        and then ask the facillator for help. I try get all my work done Monday
        to Friday, so that I know there will be someone available if I get
        really stuck.

      <h3 class="question">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h3>
      <p>
        Clear communication, feedback, tips and tricks, guidance to solve
        problems rather than give me the answers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm pretty lucky not to have any fixed commitments. I take time to spend
        with my family and friends but this is all flexible.
